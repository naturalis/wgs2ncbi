; Prefix that is used as part of autogenerated identifiers. This prefix is assigned by 
; NCBI when you initialize a new project.
prefix=L345_

; Location of the submission template as produced by 
; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/template.cgi
template=share/template.sbt

; File with additional metadata about the source organism that was sequenced.
info=share/info.ini

; File with corrected protein product names.
products=share/products.ini

; File with sequence fragments to mask (e.g. adaptors, contaminations, spurious 
; duplications)
masks=share/adaptors.ini

; Naming authority for autogenerated identifiers.
authority=gnl|NaturalisBC|

; Sequences are in FASTA format. The datafile contains the entire genome in a single file, 
; whose records can be scaffolds, contigs, chromosomes. The names of these sequences must 
; match those in the annotations.
datadir=share/tblfasta
datafile=share/example.fasta

; Annotations are in GFF3 format. The gff3file contains all the annotations in a single 
; file, whose contents are exploded into sequence-specific annotations as separate files 
; in gff3dir
gff3dir=share/gff3
gff3file=share/example.gff

; Where to write *.sqn and validation files.
outdir=share/asn1val

; Where to write the discrepancy report.

; Name for the archive to upload to NCBI

; The following options are usually best left "as is" unless you know what you're doing.

; The preferred source whose annotations to use.
source=maker

; Feature types to retain during pre-processing.
feature=CDS
feature=gene
feature=five_prime_UTR
feature=three_prime_UTR

; Number of sequences to lump in one file. Must be <= 10,000
chunksize=5000

; Minimum length of sequences to retain. Must be >= 200
minlength=200

; Number of sequences to write (used for testing). Set to 0 for all sequences.
limit=0

; Minimum length of introns to retain. Must be >= 10. In genes that have smaller introns 
; all CDS features are lumped to create a non-coding pseudogene.
minintron=10

; Location of the tbl2asn executable. If this is set to tbl2asn=tbl2asn then the 
; assumption is that it is found on the PATH.
tbl2asn=tbl2asn

; Verbosity. Can be 0, (errors only), 1 (also warnings), 2 (also info messages) or 
; 3 (also debugging messages)
verbosity=1

; Logging complexity. 0=only show log level and message; 1=also show fully qualified 
; method name, code file and line number
complexity=0
